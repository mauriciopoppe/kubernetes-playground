# Kubelet

## kubelet debugging in kind

Requirements:

- The kind worker node exposes a port used for debugging, this could be done through
  the config sent to kind (see /kind-sandbox/config-worker-dlv.yaml) or through cdebug
  which can forward requests to a running container

The steps are:

- one time env setup
  - Install tools that will allow debugging like delve and grc
  - Install a custom systemd config for the kubelet that runs it through delve
  - Install a pretty log formatter for grc, this is optional but I like a way to distinguish different lines logged
    by journalctl
  - Configure your editor to connect to the server
- normal workflow
  - make changes in the k8s codebase, recompile the kubelet and sync it to the kind node
  - restart the kubelet service
  - make your editor forward breakpoints to the delve server
  - delve will stop at the breakpoints set ðŸ¥³

### Editor (one time setup)

In my nvim editor I set the following nvim-dap lua config:

```lua
  {
    type = "go",
    name = "Attach kubelet (remote)",
    debugAdapter = "dlv-dap",
    request = "attach",
    mode = "remote",
    host = "127.0.0.1",
    port = "56268",
    stopOnEntry = false,
    -- I started the kubelet in kind through delve listening on port 56268
    -- back in my workstation I connected to it through `dlv connect :56268`
    -- Inside it I run `sources` and it printed the list of files in the kubelet (showing the full path)
    -- Based on that I added the following substitutePath rule
    substitutePath = {
      {
          from = "${workspaceFolder}",
          to = "/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/_output/dockerized/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes",
      },
    },
  },
```

### Instrument the kubelet for debugging (one time setup)

```bash
# install tooling for better logging on the worker node
# (this is for a kind cluster but a similar script should work in a VM)
docker exec -i kind-worker bash -c "
set -x; \
sed -i -re 's/ports.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list; \
sed -i -re 's/ubuntu-ports/ubuntu/g' /etc/apt/sources.list; \
apt-get update && apt-get install grc golang-go -y; \
GOPATH=/root/go go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest; \
cp /root/go/bin/dlv /usr/local/bin; \
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/kubelet-debug.service.d/
"
# setup kubelet-debug service and pretty log format
docker cp debug/kubelet/kubelet-debug.service kind-worker:/etc/systemd/system/kubelet-debug.service
docker cp debug/kubelet/10-kubeadm.conf kind-worker:/etc/systemd/system/kubelet-debug.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
docker cp debug/kubelet/conf.kubernetes kind-worker:/etc/systemd/system/kubelet-debug.service.d/conf.kubernetes
```

### Instrument the kubelet for debugging through a sidecar (alternative one time setup)

An alternative is to install the tooling needed for debugging through a sidecar
container, this can be done through [cdebug](https://github.com/iximiuz/cdebug)

- Build the kubelet-debug:latest sidecar (the Dockerfile is in this repo)

```bash
# PWD is the root of this repo
make -C ./debug kubelet-debug
```

- Instrument any `kind-worker` container

```bash
cdebug exec --image kubelet-debug:latest -it docker://kind-worker '$CDEBUG_WORKSPACE/app/kubelet-debug-entrypoint.sh'
```

### Normal workflow

In the kubernetes codebase, recompile the kubelet and run it in the worker:

```bash
# cross compile the kubelet to run in the kind-worker arch
# see /docs/kubernetes-development.md for the script to compile the kubelet inside a container
KUBE_VERBOSE=0 KUBE_FASTBUILD=true KUBE_RELEASE_RUN_TESTS=n \
  ./build/make-in-container.sh make all WHAT=cmd/kubelet DBG=1

# restart kubelet
docker cp _output/dockerized/bin/linux/arm64/kubelet kind-worker:/usr/bin/kubelet-debug
docker exec -i kind-worker bash -c "systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl restart kubelet-debug"
```

In another terminal, exec into the kind-worker container and see the kubelet output

```bash
docker exec -it kind-worker bash
journalctl --since "$(systemctl show -p ActiveEnterTimestamp kubelet-debug | awk '{print $2 $3}')" -u kubelet-debug -f | grcat /etc/systemd/system/kubelet-debug.service.d/conf.kubernetes
```

In my nvim editor set breakpoints and connect nvim-dap to the kubelet server, for more info about this
