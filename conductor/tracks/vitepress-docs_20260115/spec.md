# Specification: VitePress Documentation Migration

## 1. Overview
The goal of this track is to migrate the existing documentation in the `docs/` directory to a static site generated by VitePress. This will improve the readability, navigation, and maintainability of the project's documentation, providing a modern and accessible interface for the personal notes and experiments.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **VitePress Installation:** Initialize a new VitePress project within the existing `docs/` directory.
- **Migration Strategy:**
    - Refactor the existing Markdown files in `docs/` to be compatible with VitePress (e.g., ensuring frontmatter is correct, checking relative links).
    - Configure VitePress to serve these files.
- **Navigation:** Configure a basic sidebar and/or navbar in `.vitepress/config.js` to expose the migrated pages.
- **Build & Serve:** Ensure that the documentation can be built and served locally using standard `npm` commands (or `pnpm`/`yarn` as appropriate).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Theme:** Use the default VitePress theme with no extensive customization.
- **Performance:** The site should build and load quickly.
- **Minimalism:** Keep dependencies to a minimum; only core VitePress is required.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `docs/.vitepress/config.js` exists and is configured.
- [ ] Running `npm run docs:dev` (or equivalent) starts a local server.
- [ ] All existing markdown files in `docs/` are accessible via the generated site.
- [ ] A basic navigation structure (sidebar or nav links) allows access to key documents.
- [ ] The `README.md` in the root is either integrated or linked correctly.

## 5. Out of Scope
- Custom theming or branding beyond default configuration.
- Advanced plugins (Mermaid, etc.) for this initial migration.
- Deployment to a public host (e.g., GitHub Pages) is not part of this specific track but may be a future step.
