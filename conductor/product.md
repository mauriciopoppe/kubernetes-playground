# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
This project acts as a personal playground and knowledge base for Kubernetes. It serves as a repository for notes, learnings, and practical experiments derived from contributing to and working with Kubernetes. The primary goal is to document personal insights and provide a sandbox environment for testing various Kubernetes features and configurations.

## Target Audience
- **Myself (Primary):** As a central location for personal notes, experimental setups, and deep-dive learnings.
- **Kubernetes Developers:** Who may find the notes and reference implementations useful for understanding controllers and API interactions.

## Core Goals
- **Knowledge Retention:** To document and organize personal learnings from Kubernetes contributions and experiments.
- **Experimentation Sandbox:** To provide a safe and configured environment for testing Kubernetes features, such as debugging tools and multi-platform support.
- **Reference Implementation:** To maintain a collection of working examples to refer back to.

## Key Features
- **Educational Notes:** detailed documentation on various Kubernetes components (e.g., controllers, kubelet, runtime).
- **Modern Documentation Site:** A VitePress-powered static site for easy navigation and reading of all notes and experiments.
- **Hello World Examples:** Simple, deployable applications for both Linux and Windows containers to test basic orchestration.
- **Client-Go Examples:** "Out-of-cluster" examples demonstrating how to interact with the Kubernetes API programmatically.
- **Debugging Infrastructure:** specialized setups and configurations for debugging core components like `containerd` and `kubelet`.
